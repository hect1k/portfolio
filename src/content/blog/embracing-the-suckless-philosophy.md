After experimenting with Hyprland, a modern and feature-rich Wayland compositor, I recently made the conscious decision to switch back to the Xorg ecosystem with **DWM**—the minimalist window manager developed under the principles of the **suckless philosophy**. This choice wasn’t just about my desktop environment but rather a deeper reflection of values I want to carry not only in my computing habits but also in my everyday life.

## What is the Suckless Philosophy?

The suckless philosophy revolves around simplicity, clarity, and efficiency in software design. The suckless team believes that software should be simple and minimal, avoiding unnecessary complexity that can bog down both machines and developers. Their software—like [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) (Dynamic Window Manager), [ST](https://st.suckless.org/) (Simple Terminal), and [Slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/)—adheres to the principle of **"keep it simple, stupid" (KISS)**. This resonates strongly with the **Unix philosophy**, which advocates for:

1. Writing programs that do one thing and do it well.
2. Building small, modular programs that work seamlessly together.
3. Prioritizing simplicity and elegance over bloat and feature creep.

Suckless projects embody these ideas in their minimalist codebases. DWM, for example, is intentionally under 2000 lines of code, empowering users to audit, customize, and extend the software without wading through layers of abstraction.

## Suckless Meets Unix: A Natural Alignment

The Unix philosophy and suckless philosophy share a common disdain for unnecessary complexity. Where Unix emphasizes modularity and composability (think `grep | awk | sed` pipelines), suckless tools focus on reducing the barrier between the user and the code itself. With DWM, patching the source code directly is the norm, and this DIY approach mirrors the Unix idea of tailoring tools to the task at hand.

This synergy resonates with me. It fosters an environment where I am not just a user but an active participant in shaping my tools to my needs. It also challenges me to be deliberate in what I adopt and to question the value of the tools I use.

## My DWM Dots

One of the aspects I love about using DWM is the freedom to make it my own. Over time, I’ve customized my setup to match my specific workflow and preferences. If you're interested in seeing my configurations or trying them out, check out my DWM dots repository here: [github.com/nnisarggada/dwm-dots](https://github.com/nnisarggada/dwm-dots).

In the repo, I’ve included:

- My patches for DWM to add features while maintaining minimalism.
- A carefully curated configuration file for an efficient and clean workflow.
- Tips and notes for getting started or adapting the setup to your needs.

Feel free to fork or contribute if you share the same love for lightweight, suckless software!

## Considering DWL and Wayland

[Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) represents the future of Linux display servers, offering smoother performance and modern features compared to Xorg. I briefly considered making the leap to Wayland full-time with [DWL](https://github.com/djpohly/dwl), the suckless-inspired Wayland compositor. DWL offers the same core principles as DWM but for the Wayland ecosystem. However, Wayland's landscape still lacks a broader array of software adhering to the suckless ethos.

For now, I’ve chosen to wait. I’m watching for more "suckless-esque" projects to emerge that embrace the simplicity, efficiency, and directness I value. While [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) was a feature-rich option, its configurability didn’t align with my preference for minimalism and auditability.

## Extending the Philosophy to Everyday Life

This journey with suckless isn’t just about software; it’s a reflection of my broader values. In a world obsessed with doing more and owning more, the suckless philosophy has inspired me to **do less, but better**. Here’s how I’ve started extending these principles to everyday life:

- **Minimalism**: Just as DWM minimizes code and features, I’m decluttering my physical and digital spaces. Whether it’s reducing possessions to essentials or cleaning up my digital files, I’m learning to live with less.
- **Customization**: Much like patching DWM to suit my workflow, I’m tailoring my routines and habits to fit my priorities, rather than adopting one-size-fits-all solutions.
- **Intentionality**: The deliberate simplicity of suckless tools reminds me to choose purposefully—whether it’s the commitments I take on or the technologies I adopt.

## Closing Thoughts

Switching back to Xorg and DWM wasn’t just a technical decision—it was a personal choice grounded in values I want to uphold. The suckless philosophy serves as a reminder that **less can indeed be more**. As Wayland continues to mature and tools like DWL gain traction, I’m excited about the possibility of extending these ideals into the next generation of Linux computing.

For now, I’ll continue to build my computing environment with tools that emphasize simplicity and transparency, while striving to bring those same qualities into my life. Because in the end, suckless isn’t just about software—it’s about a way of thinking and living.
