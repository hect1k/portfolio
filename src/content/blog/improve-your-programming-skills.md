Most advice for developers focuses on speed - use this framework, that library, this new tool.
But if your goal is to actually **get better at programming**, there's a simpler (and harder) rule to follow: **build everything yourself.**

Not because your version will be better - but because writing it forces you to understand what others skip. That's how you move from *using* tools to *knowing* them.

## Why Building from Scratch Works

Libraries and frameworks hide complexity by design. They free you from decisions: routing, parsing, error handling, concurrency. That's powerful - but only when you already understand what's underneath.

When you re-create something yourself, you expose every assumption. You learn edge cases. You internalize design decisions. You build technical intuition.

As [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-programming/) points out, abstraction is necessary - but too much abstraction, too early, can stunt your growth.

## 1. Build a Minimal HTTP Server

Skip frameworks. Open a TCP socket, read HTTP request bytes, parse headers, and respond.

What you learn:

- How browsers and servers actually talk
- Why status codes, headers, and content-length matter
- How routing, sessions, and middleware evolved
- What problems frameworks are solving for you

If you want inspiration, check out this short guide on [writing an HTTP server from scratch in Python](https://bhch.github.io/posts/2017/11/writing-an-http-server-from-scratch/) or this walk-through on [building one in C](https://dev.to/jeffreythecoder/how-i-built-a-simple-http-server-from-scratch-using-c-739).

Once you've built it - even imperfectly - frameworks like Flask, Express, or FastAPI stop feeling magical.

## 2. Write a Simple CLI Tool

Rebuild tools you use daily - `grep`, `curl`, `ls`, or `wc`. Don't use any libraries beyond the bare minimum.

You'll gain:

- Argument parsing and flag handling
- Input/output streams and file buffers
- Error handling and exit codes
- Modular code design and composability

These small utilities teach you to write clean, maintainable code. The [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) is all about simple, composable tools - rebuilding them helps that sink in.

## 3. Implement a Basic Encryption System (for Learning Only)

Don't use your own crypto in production. But implementing a simplified RSA or AES gives perspective.

You'll see:

- Why randomness and padding matter
- How key exchange is nontrivial
- Why side-channel attacks and timing leaks exist
- Why cryptography libraries are so careful with edge cases

If you want a practical starting point, read this short primer on [implementing RSA in Python](https://medium.com/@gowtham180502/implementing-rsa-algorithm-using-python-836f7da2a8e0) to understand the math behind it.

## 4. Build a Tiny Database

Start with a basic key-value store, then add persistence (write-ahead logs), indexing, and transaction support.

You'll learn:

- Concurrency and locking
- Durability and crash recovery
- ACID properties
- How indexing and query planning works

[Build Your Own Database From Scratch](https://build-your-own.org/database/) is a great reference if you want to go deeper. Even a crude implementation changes how you view ORMs and SQL engines.

## 5. Design a Mini Framework

After you've built a few components manually, refactor by extracting routing, templating, and controllers. Create your own tiny “framework.”

This teaches:

- Abstraction boundaries
- When to automate vs leave explicit
- Dependency management
- When abstraction is too much vs too little

You'll start recognizing the trade-offs frameworks make - and when they're worth it.

## DO Re-Invent the Wheel - That's How You Master Programming

The point isn't to ship these projects. It's to understand why existing ones work.
You'll write clunky code, hit dead ends, and break things - but that's the process that builds real technical depth.

Every library you use later will make sense because you've already built a rough version of it yourself.

## How to Start

1. Pick one domain (networking, parsing, concurrency, storage) per month.
2. Build something minimal from scratch.
3. Write a short post about what broke and what you learned.
4. Link to references or comparisons.
5. Move to the next.

After a year, you'll have a library of real projects and a mindset most developers never reach.

You don’t improve at programming by copying others - you improve by rebuilding what you use.
So skip the shortcuts, close the tutorials for a bit, and start making things work the hard way.

That’s the way that lasts.
