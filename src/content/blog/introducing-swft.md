## The SWFT Advantage

[SWFT](https://github.com/hect1k/swft) is a lightweight and intuitive web-based file sharing service that simplifies the process of sharing files with others. With its impressive set of features, it's poised to become your go-to file sharing solution. Let's take a closer look at what sets SWFT apart:

## Seamless File Uploads and Shareable Links

SWFT makes uploading files a breeze. Whether it's a single document or a collection of photos, you can quickly and easily upload your files to the platform. Once uploaded, SWFT generates shareable links that you can send to your recipients. It's a straightforward process that eliminates the need for complex setups or software installations.

## Customizable Links for Personalized Sharing

One of SWFT's standout features is its ability to customize shareable links. Instead of sharing long and cryptic URLs, you can assign user-defined names to your links. This personal touch makes sharing files more professional and accessible.

## Time-Limited File Sharing

Privacy and security are paramount when sharing files online. SWFT allows you to set a specified time period for file retention. After this duration, your files are automatically deleted. This feature ensures that your shared files have a limited lifespan, adding an extra layer of security and privacy to your file sharing.

## Support for Command-Line Users

SWFT caters to all types of users, including those who prefer command-line tools like curl or wget. This versatility means that tech-savvy individuals can seamlessly integrate SWFT into their workflow. Here's an example command using curl to upload a file and customize your shareable link:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@path/to/your/file" -F "link=my-custom-link" -F "time=1800" https://share.nnisarg.in/upload
```

Simply replace `path/to/your/file` with the actual path to your file, `my-custom-link` with your preferred link name and `1800` with the desired time period in seconds. This command allows you to harness the power of SWFT directly from the command line, making file sharing a breeze for tech-savvy users.
