Welcome, to my digital sanctuary! In this ever-evolving landscape of technology, I've carved out my own niche, a haven where innovation meets productivity, and creativity thrives. Join me on this journey as I peel back the layers of my digital realm, revealing the tools, hardware, and development stack that power my every endeavor.

## Inside My Workstation:

Step into my workspace, where innovation takes flight. Here, [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) reigns supreme, providing the solid foundation upon which my digital adventures unfold. Paired with the sleek efficiency of [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), navigating through tasks feels effortless, like a well-choreographed dance. When it's time to delve into the intricate world of code, [neovim](https://neovim.io/) emerges as my stalwart companion, guiding my fingers through lines of logic and creativity. And for traversing the vast expanses of the internet, I rely on the steadfast companionship of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/) (only used while developing websites), guiding me through the digital wilderness with ease.

## Hardware Highlights:

Beneath the surface of this digital tapestry lies a robust infrastructure, meticulously crafted to support my every endeavor. At its core, a [AMD Ryzen 5 3500X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3500x) CPU, coupled with a [Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/16-series/) GPU, form the beating heart of this technological marvel, ensuring smooth sailing whether I'm engaged in intense work or immersive gaming experiences. 16GB of [Corsair Vengance LPX 3200MHz DDR4](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/memory/cmk16gx4m2d3200c16/vengeancea-lpx-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-dram-3200mhz-c16-memory-kit-black-cmk16gx4m2d3200c16) RAM keeps the gears turning seamlessly, while my [ViewSonic VA2406-MH](https://www.viewsonic.com/global/products/lcd/VA2406-MH) monitor delivers crisp visuals that breathe life into every pixel.

For input, I've forged a custom [Corne Split Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), a testament to personalization and ergonomic excellence. When it's time to envelop myself in the world of sound, I alternate between the [CrossBeats Roar 2.0](https://crossbeats.com/products/roar-headphone) for travel and the [Audio-Technica ATH M40X](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-eu/ath-m40x) headphones for immersive experiences. And in the realm of communication, the [Fifine Ampligame A6V](https://fifinemicrophone.com/products/fifine-ampligame-usb-microphone) mic and [Redragon Hitman GW800](https://redragon.in/products/hitman-gw800-webcam-with-built-in-dual-microphone) webcam stand as guardians, ensuring seamless connectivity in a world that thrives on collaboration.

On the go, my [Samsung Galaxy A23](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-a/galaxy-a23-light-blue-128gb-sm-a235flbtins/) keeps me tethered to the digital pulse of the world. Also, my old [81DE Lenovo ideapad 330-15IKB](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/300-series/330-15ikb-type-81de) laptop is used as a server via [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) and it steps up to the plate, ready to provide my coded creations to the world!

## Development Stack:

In the realm of development, I've curated a stack that seamlessly blends efficiency with creativity, empowering me to bring my ideas to life with unparalleled finesse. With [Astro](https://astro.build/) as my frontend framework, crafting dynamic web experiences becomes a joyous endeavor, with limitless possibilities at my fingertips. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), complemented by a touch of custom CSS, lends a touch of elegance and flair to my creations, ensuring they captivate and inspire. And when it's time to delve into the depths of backend development, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) emerge as the unsung heroes, providing the flexibility and performance necessary to breathe life into my projects.
